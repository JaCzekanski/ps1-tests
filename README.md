-------------------------|------------
gte-fuzz                 | Executes GTE opcodes with random parameters, can be used to verify against real console
test-all                 | Test all register/opcodes, generated by gte-fuzz

### MDEC

Name                     | Description
-------------------------|------------
4bit                     | ♥ Decode single 8x8 block in 4bit mode (sanitized bitstream)
8bit                     | ♥ Decode single 8x8 block in 8bit mode (sanitized bitstream)
frame                    | Framework for testing MDEC decoder, default values uses DMA for all transfers, but it can be reconfigured for PIO as well (requires manual recompilation). Two executables for 15 and 24bit modes (using DMA for MDECin, MDECout and GPU)
movie                    | Simple MDEC in-ram bitstream player (currently 200 256x240 frames at @ 10FPS)
step-by-step-log         | Manually feeds the MDEC data and monitors the MDEC status register at every step. 

### SPU

Name                     | Description
-------------------------|------------
memory-transfer          | Test DMA and regular IO transfers to SPU RAM
